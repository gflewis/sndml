The ServiceNow Data Mart Loader is a Java application which uses ServiceNow's Web Services (SOAP) API to extract meta-data and data from ServiceNow. The Loader automatically creates tables in an SQL database based on meta-data extracted from ServiceNow. It supports a variety of load and synchronization operations including 
* back-loading of historical data
* "refresh" which inserts/updates any records which have been inserted/updated in ServiceNow since the last run
* "prune" which deletes any records which have been deleted in ServiceNow since the last run
